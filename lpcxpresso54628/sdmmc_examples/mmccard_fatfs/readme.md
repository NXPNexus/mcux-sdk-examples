Overview
========
The MMCCARD FATFS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. It mounts a file 
system based on a MMC card then does "creat directory/read directory/create file/write file/read 
file" operation. The file sdhc_config.h has default SDHC configuration which can be adjusted to let
card driver has different performance. The purpose of this example is to show how to use MMCCARD 
driver based FATFS disk in SDK software.

Note:
User can use MMC plus card or emmc(on board IC, but not recommand use emmc socket,due to high speed timing restriction)

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- LPCXpresso54628 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Insert the card into the card slot

Prepare the Example
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port (J2) on twrk64f120m board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FATFS example to demonstrate how to use FATFS with MMC card.

Make file system......The time may be long if the card capacity is big.

Create directory......

Create a file in that directory......

List the file in that directory......
General file : F_1.DAT.

 Write/read file until encounters error......

Write to above created file.
Read from above created file.
Compare the read/write content.
The read/write content is consistent.

Input 'q' to quit read/write.
Input other char to read/write file again.
