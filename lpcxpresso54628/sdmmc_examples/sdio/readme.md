Overview
========
The SDIO project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. It reads/writes the SDIO card reigister. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDio driver and this is a very simple example.
Note: If the sdio card need WL_REG_ON, please connect WL_REG_ON to the sdio card VDD pin for this example.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54628 board
- Personal Computer
- SDIO card(such as wifi card, we use ATHEROS AR6233X to test)

Board settings
==============
Insert the sdio card into card slot

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
