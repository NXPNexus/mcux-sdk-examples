When the application runs to each low power mode, the device would cut off the power for specific modules to save energy. The device can be also waken up by prepared wakeup source from external event.&#10;Tips: This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste some energy. - Other low power consideration based on the actual application hardware. - In order to meet typedef power consumption of DateSheet manual, Please configure MCU under the following conditions. 鈥?Configure all pins as GPIO with pull-up resistor disabled in the IOCON block. 鈥?Configure GPIO pins as outputs using the GPIO DIR register. 鈥?Write 1 to the GPIO CLR register to drive the outputs LOW. 鈥?All peripherals disabled." toolchain="armgcc mcuxpresso" compiler="compiler_gcc" category="demo_apps" path="demo_apps/power_manager_lpc">

These descriptors are cycled from one to the other.Things to note- The descriptors of the ping pong transfer need to be aligned to size 16- The inital transfer will perform the same job as first descriptor of ping pong, so the first linkeage is to go to g_pingpong_desc[1]- g_pingpong_desc[1] then chains the g_pingpong_desc[0] as the next descriptor- The properties are set up such that g_pingpong_desc[0] (and the initial configuration uses INTA to signal back to the callback)- g_pingpong_desc[1] uses INTB to signal to the callback- The scheduled callback uses this information to know which data was last writtenA note on PerformanceThe intent of this example is to illustrate how a double-buffer scheme can be implemented using the dma. The performance of this example will be limited to how quickly the echo printer can read-out the data from the ping pong buffer and display it. This means that the example will work well if characters are entered at a rate where the DMA callback to echo the string can keep up with the input stream. Connecting the USARTRX to a continuous fast speed will cause the DMA to fall behind.
