    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
5.  Compile the demo:
    - High speed: Set USB_HOST_CONFIG_IP3516HS to 1 in board_setup.c
    - Full speed: Set USB_HOST_CONFIG_IP3516HS to 0 in board_setup.c
6.  Download the program to the target board.
7.  Press the on-board RESET button to start the demo.

Then, connect a U-disk to the USB device port of the board.
The example will display the vendor ID and the product ID of
the attached USB device, then scan the disk and dump the file
name to the serial port.

For example:

USB device: vid=0x2ce3, pid=0x6487
Find Dir: DIR_1
Find Dir: DIR_2
Find File: 1234.text
Find File: test.text
