Overview
========
The SCTimer project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK SCTimer's driver capabiltiy to generate PWM signals.
The SCTimer project enables a 32-bit counter to output two center-aligned PWM signals with parameters set to 24kHz frequency.
The duty cycles of the two PWM signals are 50% and 20%, respectively.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso51U68 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J6) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the SCTimer driver simple PWM demo in the terminal window:
