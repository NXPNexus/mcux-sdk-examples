In ADC ISR, the conversion completed flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also, the conversion result value is stored, and the ISR counter is increased. These information would be printed when the execution return to the main loop.The point is that the ADC16 interrupt configuration is set when configuring the ADC16's conversion channel. When in software trigger mode, the conversion would be launched by the operation of configuring channel, just like writing aconversion command. So if user wants to generate the interrupt every time the conversion is completed, the channel's configuration with enabling interrupt setting would be used for each conversion." toolchain="armgcc mcuxpresso" compiler="compiler_gcc" category="driver_examples/adc16" path="driver_examples/adc16/interrupt">
