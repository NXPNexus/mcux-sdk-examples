Overview
========
This example demonstrate configuration and use of the USART module in interrupt-driven 
asynchronous mode on communication with a terminal emulator calling the USART 
transactional APIs. USART will echo back every character to terminal emulator, and send
back all received characters once users press [Enter] key.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1
- MCUXpresso  11.10.0

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J4) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 9600 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Press reset button to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
Monitor the information on the debug console.

Expected Result
------------------------
- Board will print some log infomation first, and prompt users to input some character,
the received character will be echo back immediately. Once users press the [Enter] key,
board will print all the recieved character.
- Due to the value of the receive buffer is only 32, once the size of received characters
is larger than 32(contain [Enter] key), the overflow infomation will be printed. 
So, don't input too many characters in one time.
